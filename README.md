## EECS 182 HW4 – MIC Single-Stage Amplifier

This folder contains my full solution for **EECS 182 Homework 4** (MIC single-stage amplifier design using S-parameters and Smith chart techniques).

- The main write-up and final answers are in:
  - `eecs182hw4.md`
- Supporting calculation and plotting scripts:
  - `problem_calc.py` – all numerical calculations for Problems 1–4, stability, composite S‑parameters, gains, and matching.
  - `graphing_helper.py` – generates `stability_circles.png` and `loss_circle.png`.

To view the homework solution, open **`eecs182hw4.md`** (e.g., in GitHub or a Markdown viewer). The figures referenced in the markdown (`HW4.JPG`, `stability_circles.png`, `loss_circle.png`, `input_smith.jpeg`, `output_smith.jpeg`, `bias_drawing.jpeg`) are all in this directory.
